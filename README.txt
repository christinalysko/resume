my main goal for my resume site was to express a quality that is unique to my style in my code. 
I do not believe I was able to do this in this first zip file. I will be working to make adjustments over the
weekend, I would like to add a more solid grid structure, add in my own illustrations, and incorporate a gif somewhere.
I will be looking for feedback in our next class meeting, as my resume will probably be a whole new html file.
